# Complexity

1. Omega - Best case (lower bound)
2. Theta - Average case
3. Big O - Worst case (upper bound) *** This is what we care about ***

> Expect the worst, hope for the best.

## Levels of complexity

- O(1)          : One calculation
- O(log n)      : 
- O(n)          : For loop for every element
- O(n log(n))   : Heap Sort
- O(n^2)        : Bubble Sort, for loop inside a for loop for every element
- O(2^n)        : 
- O(n!)         :

## Finding Code Complexity

- Arithmetic statement - 1 step
- Memory access - 1 step
- Loop / Subroutine - n steps
